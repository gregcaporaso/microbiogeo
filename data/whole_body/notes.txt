# Original OTU table is otu_table.biom.orig
# Original mapping file is map.txt.orig

# Created copy of original mapping file (map.clean.txt) and added
# BODY_SITE_CLEAN category, which is the same as BODY_SITE except that UBERON:
# has been removed. This was necessary to perform filtering of samples using
# QIIME.

# Filtered out all genital, urine, and nostril samples (based on BODY_SITE
# category). Added BODY_SITE_COARSE category to designate skin, oral, and gut
# samples.
