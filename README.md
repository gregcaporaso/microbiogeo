microbiogeo
===========
Repository for code, data, and analysis results of the biogeographical
statistical methods comparison project (aka ```microbiogeo```).

To run the code in this repository, you will need the latest development
version of QIIME installed, with ```microbiogeo/code``` added to your
```PYTHONPATH``` and ```microbiogeo/code/scripts``` added to your ```PATH```.

You can run all of the unit tests with the following command (assuming you are
in the ```microbiogeo/``` directory):

    python code/tests/all_tests.py
