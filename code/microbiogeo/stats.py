This module provides functionality for the application of various statistical
methods to QIIME-formatted datasets.

The module provides an API that allows users to easily apply any number of
statistical analyses and just as easily retrieve the results. The module also
provides a hierarchy of statistical classes that can be inherited from to
create new statistical method implementations.
